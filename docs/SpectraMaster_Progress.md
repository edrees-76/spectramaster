# SpectraMaster development progress

This document tracks the plan in `docs/SpectraMaster_Development_Plan_EN.md`: the stages,
their acceptance criteria and status, and any justified changes to the plan. The plan itself is
not edited.

Status values:

- **done**: implemented and tested within the stated scope.
- **in progress**: partly implemented.
- **open**: not started.
- **blocked**: needs data or information that is not available.

## Release A: accuracy baseline and the detector, geometry and session models

| Increment | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| A0. Review of the plan against the repository; existing tests run | done | `docs/SpectraMaster_Baseline_Report.md` section 4. Full test suite: 639 passed, 66 skipped (reasons recorded below). |
| A1. Acceptance limits fixed before measuring | done | `spectramaster/validation/acceptance.py`, committed in its own commit before the first benchmark run |
| A2. Reproducible benchmark harness: synthetic HPGe/NaI, IAEA G-1, EML | done | `spectramaster/validation/`, `tests/test_validation_baseline.py` |
| A3. Baseline report | done | `docs/baseline/baseline.md` (generated), `docs/SpectraMaster_Baseline_Report.md` (interpretation) |
| A4. Data models: detector profile, geometry, calibration record, sample, analysis session, edit history with undo/redo, schema versioning and migration | done (library level) | `spectramaster/lab/`, `tests/test_lab_models.py`, `tests/test_lab_session.py` |
| A6. Fix P1 (strong unresolved doublet silently discarded) | done | `peaks.py` doublet retry; regression test; `docs/baseline/after_P1/` shows no criterion changed status |
| A7. Mass/volume uncertainty removed from u(Bq), kept in the specific activity | done | `analysis/activity.py`; `tests/test_activity.py` |
| A5. Session integration in the GUI (open/save session, display stored vs recalculated results) | open | Planned for Release B together with the peak-inspection window |

Stage 2 acceptance criterion: reopening a session restores its state, and changes to a
calibration or library do not silently alter previous results.

- At library level this is covered by the round-trip, staleness and undo/redo tests.
- At GUI level it is not covered yet (A5).

## Skipped tests in the existing suite (2026-10-14, this machine)

- 64: test_corpus files whose format is not detected (InterSpec RADDATA `.txt`, non-gamma xylib files, and others).
- 1: `test.spe` not readable.
- 1: the installed SandiaSpecUtils has no IEC 1455 parser.

The lab Aptec spectra, IAEA G-1, EML and TECDOC-2026 tests ran, because those data sets are
present on this machine under `D:/الاسس و المفاهيم العامة فى استخدام برامج الطيف الجامى/اطياف مرجعية`.
On another machine they are skipped.

## Justified changes and additions to the plan

1. **The plan document was copied into `docs/`.** It was supplied outside the repository
   (`Downloads`) and the skill expects it at `docs/SpectraMaster_Development_Plan_EN.md`.
2. **External reference spectra are referenced, not copied.** IAEA G-1 and EML are used from a local
   directory (`SPECTRAMASTER_REFDATA`). G-1 is described as public domain in its README. The EML
   files' licence is not stated, so they are not redistributed.
3. **Informational benchmark variants were added after the first run, with no acceptance limits:**
   - a broad Compton edge (8 keV / 15 keV extra smearing);
   - NaI on a 4096-channel MCA with no detector label.

   They do not replace or relax any pre-registered criterion. They show how much of the
   Compton-edge failure comes from the worst-case sharpness of the synthetic edge, and they
   reproduce defect P1 below.
